# The Odin Project: Admin Dashboard

This is my admin dashboard for The Odin Project. Taught me a lot about CSS Grid and layouts and how to configure them responsively. Some things I would still like to work on are how to organize my code better and getting a little more familiar with how CSS Grid works. This is only the first draft and there are many more revisions I would like to make.
